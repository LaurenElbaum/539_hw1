<h2>CHALLENGE: FINDING THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Our client, an inbox team in a government agency, expressed their frustration at having too many emails and not enough time to answer them. The team responded to questions from all over the world, about many topics. They wanted to spend less time on emails, send email responses faster, and maintain their relationship with the public.</p>

<h2>OUR TEAM'S PROCESS</h2>
<h3>Observation</h3>
<p>Our team observed an inbox team meeting. We observed group dynamics, team members expertise, and their email delegation process.
</p>

<h3>Semi-structured Interview</h3>
<p>Our team interviewed five members of a government agency’s inbox team. Each interview lasted approximately 90 minutes yielding qualitative data.
</p>

<h3>Interpretation Session</h3>
<p>We played the audio recordings of the interviews and transcribed key facts that surfaced in each interview.
</p>


<h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
<p>We put our key findings on sticky notes. Then we grouped those findings and then, like pieces of a puzzle, made meta groupings. These meta groupings echoed the overarching themes that the inbox team experienced.
</p>

<h4>Themes from the Affinity Diagram</h4>
<ol>    
        <li>Unclear email questions</li>
        <li>FAQ page design needs improvement</li>
        <li>Current work process of email response: Delegation, Tracking, Responding</li>
        <li>Organizational constraints: Security, Lack of Resources, Technical constraints</li>       
</ol>
