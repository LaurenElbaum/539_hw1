<h2>CHALLENGE: WHAT INFORMATION HELPS CUSTOMERS BUY SHOES?</h2>
<p>Zappos is an online shoe store. As frequent online shoppers, my research partner and I were curious what search features enable users to find shoes they want and then after that, what information helps them decide which shoes to put in their cart.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>My Role</strong></p> 
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>UX Researcher</li>
    <li>Editor</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- How to I get this list to be up and down instead of inline-block? -->


    <p><strong>Duration</strong></p> 
<br/>
<p>2 Weeks </p>

    

<br/>
<h2>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</h2>

<ol>
        <li>1. Which search features enable users to find the shoe they want?</li>
        <li>2. Which information helps users decide which shoes to put in their cart?</li>
        <li></li>
        
</ol>

<h2>METHODS</h2>
<ol>
    <li>We recruited a convenience sample of five female graduate students to perform four randomized search tasks.</li>
    <li>We watched and recorded their search behavior using screen sharing</li>
    <li>Subjects could add as many items to the cart as they wished and were asked to pick only one at the end of each task.</li> 
        
</ol>

<h3>Interpretation Session</h3>
<p>We played the audio recordings of the interviews and transcribed key facts that surfaced in each interview.
