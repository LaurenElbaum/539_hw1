<h2>High level summary:</h2>
<p>I solved problems using a design while striking the optimum balance between effective design and minimal development effort.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>My Role</strong></p> 
<br/>
<p>PM/Experience Designer</p>
<br/>
<h2>Challenge:</h2>
<p>The Customer-Care Center came with a two-fold problem. The results of a transaction search were taking too long for customer-care representatives to load in order to give the customers a good experience when they called for help. The customer-care center's manager asked if we could limit the amount of results that loaded and search all the results by date range. Let's look at the date range filter.

<!-- How to I make this image bigger and not the other one? -->

<h2>Understanding the problem.</h2>
<p>The customer-care web app retrieved every single transaction from a transaction search. Some customers have hundreds, even thousands of transactions. Finding an individual transaction was an arduous process for a customer-care representative.</p>

<h2>Ideation</h2>
<p>As I was brainstorming solutions visually I began thinking through the requirements for the user story.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Dates that haven't happened are greyed out</li>
	<li>The end date cannot be before the start date</li>
	<li>Dates in range are highlighted</li>

</ol> 

<p>
Meeting with the BAs and POs gave me insight into the requirements and the design. For example, the calendar search is only the beginning. They hope to add more types of filters in the future. So, I created a “FILTER TRANSACTIONS” button instead of a calendar button.

Talking to the developers gave me insight into how much work a design would be. For example, is it possible to highlight the days within a selection?

What changed: The text and buttons are larger. The size and location of the cancel button are easier to see.
More about the redesign is coming soon.
